Hey, I'm Francis.

I'm a post-doctoral researcher working on getting better at version control as I develop analysis pipelines for the lab I work in.

For now most of my projects for the lab will likely be listed as private, but I'm hoping to open them up to share (and get feedback/corrections on my coding habits) in the future.

I've worked mostly with Python, Matlab, and R in the past 6 years but I'm always looking to improve (my code readability / formatting is still pretty bad)!
