Hey, I'm fxsmith1824.

I'm an assistant research scientist working on getting better at version control as I develop analysis pipelines for the lab I work in.

For now most of my projects for the lab will likely be listed as private, but I'm hoping to open them up to share (and get feedback/corrections on my coding habits) in the future.

I've worked mostly with Python, Matlab, and R in the past 6 years but I'm always looking to improve (my code readability / formatting is still pretty bad)!

Other repositories you might find here are just side projects I've worked on for fun. I do not currently maintain any of them at a reasonable level but keep them available here anyways.
